# RISC-V based Microprocessor
RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration. Born in academia and research, RISC-V ISA delivers a new level of free, extensible software and hardware freedom on architecture, paving the way for the next 50 years of computing design and innovation. A number of companies are offering or have already announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular software [toolchains][10].

This repository contains all the information needed to build your RISC-V pipelined core, which has support of base interger RV32I instruction format and testing it with a simple C code using TL-Verilog on [Makerchip IDE platform][9].
